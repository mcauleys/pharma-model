This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

unit_sales <- function(quarter){
  procedures <- 0
  
  for (t in 1:quarter){
    if (t > 1 & t < 5){
      procedures = procedures + 10
    }
    else if (t > 4) {
      procedures = procedures + 25
    }
  }
  return(procedures)
}

unit_revenue <- function(units){
  revenue = 4000*units + 3000*units
  
  return(revenue)
}


```

```{r}
for (q in 1:8){
  print(unit_sales(q))
}
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
